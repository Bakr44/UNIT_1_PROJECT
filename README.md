# UNIT_1_PROJECT

## Based on what youâ€™ve learned until now , create a project of your choosing (impress us with your imagination) . This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements :

- Must be interactive on CLI.
- Use lists or dictionaries or tuples. 
- Use loops.
- Use functions that return an output . 
- Use a Lambda function.
- Use at least 1 Class.
- Use some form of Error Handling .
- Organize Your Code into modules & (or packages)

## Example Project :  An online Grocery Store :

### For your project. Edit this README.md file to include your own project name,  overview, user stories, and usage. 

### Project Structure
 - The Password Manager project is structured as follows:


main.py: The main module of the project. It contains the code for the command-line interface and the logic for managing passwords.
password.py: The module that defines the Password class.
encryption.py: A module that contains functions for encrypting and decrypting data.
input_validator.py: A module that contains a function for validating user input.

### Function
### The Password class has the following attributes:

name: A string representing the name of the password.
username: A string representing the username associated with the password.
password: A string representing the password.

### The Password class has the following methods:

encrypt_password(self, master_password): Encrypts the password using the master password.
decrypt_password(self, master_password): Decrypts the password using the master password.

### The main.py module has the following function:

add_password(): Prompts the user for a password name, username, and password, creates a new Password object, encrypts the password, and stores it in a file.
view_passwords(): Prompts the user for a master password, reads the password file, decrypts the passwords, and displays them in a user-friendly format.
delete_password(): Prompts the user for a password name, reads the password file, deletes the password if found, and rewrites the password file.

### The encryption.py module has the following function:

encrypt_data(data, key): Encrypts data using a key and returns the encrypted data.
decrypt_data(data, key): Decrypts data using a key and returns the decrypted data.

### The input_validator.py module has the following functionality:

validate_string_input(prompt): Prompts the user for a string and returns it if valid. Handles invalid input by displaying an error message and re-prompting the user.


### The program will display a prompt and wait for the user to enter a command. The available commands are:

a: Add a new password
v: View passwords
d: Delete a password
q: Quit the program

Here is an example session:


Welcome to the Password Manager!

Enter a command (a/v/d/q): a
Enter password name: Facebook
Enter username: johndoe
Enter password: mypassword
Enter master password: secret
Password saved successfully!

Enter a command (a/v/d/q): v
Enter master password: secret
Passwords:
- Facebook
  - Username: johndoe
  - Password: mypassword

Enter a command (a/v/d/q): d
Enter password name: Facebook
Enter master password: secret
Password deleted successfully!

Enter a command (a/v/d/q): v
Enter master password: secret
No passwords found.

Enter a command (a/v/d/q): q
Goodbye!
